# Progress Log

## December 2024

### Research Agent Implementation (Major Feature)

**Days 1-2 Complete: Backend Foundation**
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Research insights and subreddit cache tables
- ✅ **Edge Function**: Complete Reddit scraping and LLM integration system
- ✅ **Critical Fixes**: 
  - Replaced Puppeteer with Reddit JSON API (edge function compatibility)
  - Added markdown code block parsing for LLM responses
- ✅ **Testing**: End-to-end workflow validated and deployed

**Technical Achievements:**
- Reddit API integration with rate limiting and error handling
- Claude LLM integration for subreddit discovery and insight classification
- PostgreSQL caching system for performance optimization
- Robust error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- Bundle optimization (80.96kB vs original 422.4kB)

**Status**: Backend research system fully operational, ready for frontend integration

### Media Agent Improvements & Manual Upload Implementation 

**Image Relevance Issues Resolved**
- ✅ **Query Simplification**: Fixed media agent returning irrelevant images due to overly complex search queries
- ✅ **Prompt Architecture Fix**: Resolved database vs code prompt mismatch - confirmed database-driven approach
- ✅ **Edge Function Enhancement**: Added query mapping logic to convert complex queries to simple 1-3 word terms
- ✅ **Documentation Updates**: Updated memory bank across 4 files emphasizing database-driven prompt management

**UI Cleanup Complete**
- ✅ **Input Page Refinements**: Removed subtitle, company description text, YAML toggle (always on)
- ✅ **Default Settings**: Made Reddit research agent default to ON state
- ✅ **Component Updates**: Modified FormSection.tsx, CompanyField.tsx, ContentOptionsField.tsx, types.ts

**Manual Media Upload System (In Progress)**
- 🏗️ **Multiple File Support**: Updated data structure from single `mediaFile` to `mediaFiles[]` array
- 🏗️ **Enhanced UI**: Improved MediaField component with multiple file selection and individual file removal
- 🏗️ **Manual Mode Detection**: Started ResultsPage updates to use uploaded files instead of AI suggestions
- 🏗️ **File Handling**: Converting uploaded files to MediaImageSpot objects using URL.createObjectURL

**Technical Achievements:**
- Media agent query simplification includes specific mappings for common complex terms
- Database prompt architecture prevents code/database conflicts
- Manual upload mode bypasses media-agent service for user-provided images
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms for image search

**Status**: Media agent relevance issues resolved, UI cleanup complete, manual upload system 70% implemented

### Previous Project Milestones

**Project Foundation**
- ✅ React frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

**Next Steps**
- 🏗️ Research Agent UI components (Days 3-4)
- 🏗️ Content pipeline integration (Days 5-6)
- 🏗️ Testing and refinement (Days 7-8)
- 🏗️ Documentation and deployment (Day 9)

## Key Learnings

**Technical Decisions**
- Edge function environment requires careful dependency selection
- LLM integration needs defensive JSON parsing strategies
- Caching at database level provides significant performance benefits
- Reddit JSON API more reliable than browser automation for scraping

**Architecture Insights**
- Modular edge function design enables easier testing and debugging
- Proper error handling and fallbacks maintain user experience
- Database schema evolution requires careful validation of relationships
- Performance optimization critical for user-facing research features
