# Progress Log

## December 2024

### Research Agent Implementation (Major Feature)

**Days 1-2 Complete: Backend Foundation**
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Research insights and subreddit cache tables
- ✅ **Edge Function**: Complete Reddit scraping and LLM integration system
- ✅ **Critical Fixes**: 
  - Replaced Puppeteer with Reddit JSON API (edge function compatibility)
  - Added markdown code block parsing for LLM responses
- ✅ **Testing**: End-to-end workflow validated and deployed

**Technical Achievements:**
- Reddit API integration with rate limiting and error handling
- Claude LLM integration for subreddit discovery and insight classification
- PostgreSQL caching system for performance optimization
- Robust error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- Bundle optimization (80.96kB vs original 422.4kB)

**Status**: Backend research system fully operational, ready for frontend integration

### Previous Project Milestones

**Project Foundation**
- ✅ React frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Supabase backend with authentication and database
- ✅ Multi-agent content generation system
- ✅ Content history and management features

**Core Features Complete**
- ✅ User authentication and session management
- ✅ Content generation with multiple agents
- ✅ History tracking and content management
- ✅ Responsive UI with modern design

**Next Steps**
- 🏗️ Research Agent UI components (Days 3-4)
- 🏗️ Content pipeline integration (Days 5-6)
- 🏗️ Testing and refinement (Days 7-8)
- 🏗️ Documentation and deployment (Day 9)

## Key Learnings

**Technical Decisions**
- Edge function environment requires careful dependency selection
- LLM integration needs defensive JSON parsing strategies
- Caching at database level provides significant performance benefits
- Reddit JSON API more reliable than browser automation for scraping

**Architecture Insights**
- Modular edge function design enables easier testing and debugging
- Proper error handling and fallbacks maintain user experience
- Database schema evolution requires careful validation of relationships
- Performance optimization critical for user-facing research features
