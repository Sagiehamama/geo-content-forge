- Consistent with Research Agent's detailed step tracking

**Status**: Media Agent XRAY now shows complete multi-step workflow for full transparency

### Media Agent Fallback System Bug Fix (Critical)

**Problem Identified**
- ✅ **Inappropriate vegan food fallbacks** - When image searches failed (like "Clickup"), system defaulted to "vegan food"
- ✅ **Legacy hardcoded terms** - Fallback array contained `['vegan food', 'plant based meal', 'healthy food', 'vegetables', 'vegan restaurant']`
- ✅ **Irrelevant results** - Users getting vegan food images for business/tech content

**Root Cause Analysis**
- Media Agent had hardcoded vegan-specific fallback terms from previous project
- When Unsplash searches returned 0 results, system used inappropriate fallbacks
- Default fallback was literally "vegan food" regardless of content topic

**Fix Applied**
- ✅ **Updated fallback terms** - Changed to `['office', 'business', 'technology', 'workspace', 'computer', 'teamwork']`
- ✅ **Generic default** - Changed default from "vegan food" to "business"
- ✅ **Deployed to production** - Media Agent edge function updated and deployed

**Technical Achievements:**
- Eliminated inappropriate vegan food images appearing in business/tech content
- Fallback system now provides contextually relevant images
- Maintains graceful degradation when specific searches fail
- Universal fallback terms work for most content types

**Status**: Media Agent fallback system now provides appropriate generic images instead of vegan food

### Media Agent Architecture Fix (Prompt & XRAY Updates)

**Updated Media Agent Prompt**
- ✅ **Priority logic implemented** - First scan for existing [IMAGE:tag] markers from Content Agent
- ✅ **Brand name avoidance** - Clear instructions to convert brand names to conceptual terms
- ✅ **Fallback behavior** - Only analyze content if no markers exist from Content Agent
- ✅ **Simple search queries** - Maintains 1-3 word limit for better Unsplash results

**XRAY Step Updates**
- ✅ **Step 1: Image Marker Detection** - Changed from "Semantic Marker Extraction" to clarify purpose
- ✅ **Step 2: Image Search (Marker-Based)** - Emphasizes using Content Agent's tags
- ✅ **Better metadata tracking** - Shows source of search terms and decision logic
- ✅ **Clear fallback indication** - When no markers exist, shows "no_content_agent_markers"

**Technical Achievements:**
- Eliminated architectural confusion between Content Agent and Media Agent roles
- Fixed brand name searches (Clickup → task management)
- Improved XRAY transparency showing decision logic
- Maintained backward compatibility for content without markers

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor for improved search relevance
- Consider long-term architectural cleanup (single agent responsibility)

**Status**: Media Agent prompt and XRAY steps updated to reflect proper architecture and avoid brand name searches

### Media Agent Architecture Cleanup (Complete Separation of Concerns)

**Problem Identified**
- ✅ **Architectural confusion** - Media Agent was doing content analysis when no markers existed
- ✅ **Duplicate responsibilities** - Both Content Agent and Media Agent were choosing image locations
- ✅ **Unnecessary AI calls** - Media Agent was calling OpenAI when it should only search images

**Root Cause Analysis**
- Content Agent already handles ALL image placement logic (including mathematical positioning)
- If no [IMAGE:...] markers exist, it indicates a Content Agent error, not a fallback scenario
- Media Agent's only job should be: scan for markers → search images for those markers

**Complete Fix Applied**
- ✅ **Removed AI analysis fallback** - Eliminated entire OpenAI integration for content analysis
- ✅ **Error handling** - Media Agent now returns proper error when no markers found
- ✅ **Simplified logic** - Only two paths: markers exist (success) or markers missing (error)
- ✅ **XRAY updates** - Step 1 shows "failed" status when no markers found
- ✅ **Reduced bundle size** - Removed unnecessary AI parsing and fallback code

**Technical Achievements:**
- Clean separation of concerns: Content Agent = placement, Media Agent = image search
- Eliminated architectural confusion and duplicate responsibilities
- Proper error handling when Content Agent fails to provide markers
- Simplified Media Agent logic from ~750 lines to ~400 lines
- No more unnecessary OpenAI API calls for content analysis

**Status**: Media Agent now has single responsibility (image search) with proper error handling for missing markers

### Content History Page UI/UX Improvements (List Layout & Date Fix)

**Problems Identified**
- ✅ **Gallery layout inappropriate** - Card grid layout made scanning content difficult
- ✅ **Date calculation bug** - All content showing "Today" instead of actual creation dates
- ✅ **Poor information hierarchy** - Important details buried in small text

**Date Calculation Fix**
- ✅ **Fixed logic error** - Changed `diffDays === 1` to `diffDays === 0` for "Today"
- ✅ **Improved precision** - Changed `Math.ceil()` to `Math.floor()` for accurate day calculation
- ✅ **Enhanced formatting** - Added week display (`2w ago`) and year when different
- ✅ **Better date display** - Shows actual dates for older content instead of generic "Today"

**Layout Transformation**
- ✅ **Gallery to list** - Changed from `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` to `space-y-3`
- ✅ **Horizontal layout** - Content details now flow left-to-right for better scanning
- ✅ **Improved hierarchy** - Title, date, and metadata prominently displayed
- ✅ **Better actions** - "View" button more prominent, delete button secondary
- ✅ **Responsive design** - Layout works well on all screen sizes

**Technical Achievements:**
- Fixed date calculation logic that was causing all content to show "Today"
